<p>The Offline Project, the inaugural venture of Offline Observer, aims to bring traditional games and pastimes into the digital age. Our mission is to make these time-honored activities, whose origins often trace back through generations, accessible on smart devices without the need for an internet connection.</p>



<p>These games and pastimes, while their exact origins may be unclear, have been passed down and adapted over time. They represent a rich tapestry of cultural heritage that we seek to preserve and share. By making these traditional activities available in a portable, offline format, we aim to contribute to both the enjoyment and educational development of our users.</p>



<p>Our goal is to safeguard diverse cultural traditions while fostering human intellectual growth. We believe that by providing easy access to these games, we can help maintain connections to our shared past while promoting cognitive development and social interaction in the present.</p>



<p>Why isn&#8217;t this an open-source project? Currently, the Offline Project is not open-source. As the creator, I need to maintain my livelihood while pursuing this creative and philanthropic endeavor. I&#8217;ve chosen to utilize online platforms for rapid information dissemination while developing offline-capable applications. This approach allows me to balance my passion for innovation with my desire to make a positive impact.</p>



<p>Once my personal financial stability is secured and I feel I&#8217;ve accomplished my primary objectives with this project, I will seriously consider transitioning to an open-source model. At that point, I hope to make the project as accessible as possible to those interested in studying and contributing to it.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s crucial to understand that this project&#8217;s primary goal is the advancement of human knowledge and intellectual growth. While direct copying, reproduction, or redistribution of the content is not permitted, sharing through the front-end features provided within the application is encouraged.</p>



<p>I assure you that when the time is right, I will give serious thought to open-sourcing this project in a way that makes it easily approachable for those who wish to learn from and contribute to it. Until then, I invite you to enjoy the content and experience the benefits it offers.</p>
